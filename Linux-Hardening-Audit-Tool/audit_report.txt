Recommendations:
========================================
[Firewall Configuration] (High) -> Set default inbound policy to deny (e.g., 'sudo ufw default deny incoming').
[SSH Configuration] (High) -> Set 'PermitRootLogin no' and reload SSH ('sudo systemctl reload sshd').
[SSH Configuration] (High) -> Disable password auth: set 'PasswordAuthentication no' and use SSH keys.
[SSH Configuration] (Medium) -> Reduce 'MaxAuthTries' to 4 or fewer and reload SSH.
[SSH Configuration] (Low) -> Set 'ClientAliveInterval' to 600s or less (e.g., 300) and reload SSH.
[Key File Permissions] (Medium) -> Remove or secure backup files in /etc (e.g., *.bak, *.old).
[Rootkit Indicators] (Medium) -> Install a scanner (e.g., rkhunter) and run regular checks.
